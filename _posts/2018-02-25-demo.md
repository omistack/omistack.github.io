We used Up-Boards as compute nodes and a HP server to host the controller components. The video starts from scratch, first installing the container orchestrator Rancher, which is then used to deploy all the necessary containers. The steps shown in the video are as simple as follows:

- Step 1: Prepare Controller
- Step 2: Install Rancher
- Step 3: Add Rancher Agent
- Step 4: Deploy Boot Services
- Step 5: Power On Nodes
- Step 6: Deploy OpenStack
