# Implementation

The Omistack setup bases on software components like iPXE, CoreOS7, Matchbox8, Docker, and container orchestrators. The Seed entity provides network boot for servers, which then use a container cluster to receive their configuration and containers to run OpenStack. Each container is then self contained, packaged with software and configuration parameters, and its own state machine to start its service with  existing state, immutably.

![Architecture Overview](assets/img/impl.png)

The OpenStack Docker images are written from scratch to con-figure and boot themselves from environment variables, sidekick containers or remote storage. In contrast to our approach, OpenStack Kolla² orchestrates containers via external Ansible rules, and would need additional support for the physical infrastructure from e.g. Cannonical MaaS³. Configuration man-agement tools like Ansible4, or Puppet5 describe and implement changes, reducing immutability.

Since 06.2018 the entire operation of our IT infrastructure follows this paradigm. We are investigating in integrating Kubernetes.
