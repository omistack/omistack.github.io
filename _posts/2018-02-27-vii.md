Omistack is developed with the concept of a **Vertical Immutable Infrastructure** in mind. What does this mean?

- **Vertical**: Cloud native from application to physical layer
- **Immutable:** Detect separated state at run time

### Our Paradigms

- **Single Point of Truth:** Declarative - explain result, not the path
- **Phoenix Server:** Replace instead of change 
- **Self Contained State Machine:** Avoid configuration drift

### Motivation

Maintaining a physical server cluster can by a time consuming and error prone task. Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) recently becomes common standard on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Clouds. **Omistack takes modern well-known CI/CD concepts down to the physical servers**.

## Architecture Overview

A declarative description of the server cluster defines the required deployment state of an application installation. The pre-configured bootstrap entity (Seed node) rolls out configuration and runtime software. Each component configures, deploys, and manages its state autonomously.

A runtime component in this context can be an operating system image, or a container image for application software. This architecture allows users to create or replace the components. **Fail fast & retry** guarantees an eventual success. The Seed node as a central entity is only required for initialization or for changes, to avoid a single point of failure .
