# Introduction

OMIStack<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> describes the OpenStack<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> installation of the "Institute of Information Resource Management
", as well as its therefore developed management infrastructure. OpenStack is a Cloud Middleware which allows the management of Datacentre resources like Compute, Storage and Network via a self-service dashboard and API.

A specialty is the deployment of OMIStack. Hereby we make heavy use of the "Immutable Infrastructure"<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup> paradigm. We perceive each component as a unit which is never updated but rather redeployed completely. These components automatically find their state since it exists remotly.  

We implement this approach by using Docker<sup>[4](#fn4)</sup> containers for the components and CoreOS<sup>[5](#fn5)</sup> as operating system.
